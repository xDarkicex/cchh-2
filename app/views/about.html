                    <p>Compassionate Care Mobile Health, NPO 501(C)(3), was born
                      out of a dream and desire to give back to humanity in a
                      meaningful way by providing quality medical care to
                      Californiaâ€™s most underserved, vulnerable and increasingly
                      growing population; individuals experiencing homelessness.
                      Undoubtedly, California has the nation's most prevalent
                      homeless population. As of January 2018, California had an
                      estimated 129,972 individuals experiencing homelessness, as
                      reported by Continuums of Care to the U.S. Department of
                      Housing and Urban Development (HUD); showing that
                      approximately one-quarter of the nationwide homeless
                      population lives within California alone. We're one of the
                      two states in our nation that holds over a 6% total
                      population attributed to homelessness. This abnormal crisis
                      can be attributed to multiple variables; however, with great
                      hardship comes abundant opportunity. A carefully selected team of qualified professionals and volunteers have joined forces to provide services and 'compassionately care' for individuals experiencing homelessness, who are in need of medical attention - in situ, via a fully customized mobile health clinic. The project originated within the famed
                      Silicon Valley of The Golden State; Palo Alto, California
                      and is honored to collaborate with scholars at Stanford
                      University to provide services for affected populations in
                      the greater Bay Area. The mobile clinic was fashioned from a
                      46' overall length gooseneck style trailer shell featuring all the medical amenities needed for high-level care.</p>

                      We plan on using our program design to provide consistent access to basic healthcare needs for individuals within our communities who would otherwise utilize emergency rooms for routine needs, or delay seeking medical attention until simple ailments turn into life-threatening situations.
                      Compassionate Care Mobile Health will provide a consistent
                      face of medicine to those within our communities, enabling
                      us to establish rapport and build trust with individuals who
                      often feel abandoned and alone. Our goal is that with the relationships we build - with the homeless, community resources, and local medical professionals, we can transition these individuals to primary care physicians once they are established with resources. Our vision is a long-term solution to the epidemic that is affecting hospitals nationwide and we are certain that is something we can achieve.
